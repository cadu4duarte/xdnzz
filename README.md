**Hello from Recife, PE. Web Developer at MELHOR COMUNICAÃ‡ÃƒO** 
Currently learning ReactJS ðŸ¤–

**About me**

Since forever studying to become the best version of myself. In 2020 I've decided to dive into the IT World, and honestly, that was one of the bests decisions I have made.
I am currently working as a Front-end developer, using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, JAVASCRIPT, WORDPRESS, PHP and a little bit of MySQL.
They were also a self-taught, currently learning ReactJS, which I used in some personal projects. Always willing to learn.
Iam aiming to learn NodeJS and MongoDB, but step-by-step!
